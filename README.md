The graph above shows the distributions of loans with the original loan amount vs. the credit score of the borrower. This was done for loans granted before January 2009(pre2009) and after January 2009(post2009). In late 2008 there was a market crash and it appears loans were granted differently before and after January 2009. This graph was created to see if we can determine what the criteria for granting a loan were before January 2009 and if the criteria changed after January 2009.

The blue line represents the median loan amount over the different credit scores of the borrowers. An alpha of 1/40 was used to better visualize the distribution. The dotted blue lines below and above the median line represent the 10th and 90th Quintile, respectively. The dotted red line represents the sum of all loans across the credit scores of the borrowers.

From these graphs we can clearly see some of the loan criteria. For example prior to January 2009 the maximum loan was $25,000 and after January 2009 the maximum loan was $35,000. Below are other apparent criteria for granting loans before and after January 2009:

Apparent pre2009 guidelines for loan approval:
- no loans above $25,000
- no loans above $15,000 with a credit score less than 550
- no loans above about $2,000 with a credit score less than 440
- no loans with a credit score less than about 380
Apparent pre2009 guidelines for loan approval:
- no loans above $35,000
- no loans above $25,000 with a credit score less than 710
- no loans above $15,000 with a credit score less than 650
- no loans with a credit score less than about 600
This may explain the increase in NetProfit after 2009 we will see below.
